# RSJSCC
Really Simple JS Caesar Cipher
This is a simple version of a Caesar cipher written in JavaScript. It can encrypt or decrypt text based on a user-defined rot. In addition to letters, this also encrypts numbers and symbols. Depending on the rot, a letter can be encrypted as a number or symbol. It still has some issues decrypting non-alphanumeric characters with certain rots.
